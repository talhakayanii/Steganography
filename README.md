# Steganography
## Description:

This project implements a steganography technique where secret data (such as a text message or another image) is embedded into an image by manipulating its least significant bits (LSB). The main idea is to encode the secret information within the image in a way that is invisible to the human eye. The process is done by replacing the least significant bits of an image with the data we want to hide.

## Key Steps:

### Image Loading:

The cover image is loaded using image processing libraries like OpenCV.

### Encoding Secret Information:

The secret data (text, message, or another image) is converted to a binary format.

The least significant bits (LSBs) of the cover image are replaced with the secret data's binary representation.

### Bitwise Operations:

Bitwise AND and bitwise OR operations are used to modify the LSBs of each pixel, hiding the secret information without altering the appearance of the image significantly.

### Decoding the Hidden Message:

The process for extracting the hidden data involves reversing the bitwise operations on the modified image to retrieve the original secret message.

## Output:

The resulting image appears visually similar to the original image but contains hidden data that can be retrieved using the correct decoding algorithm.

## Example Use Case:

Message Hiding: A text message can be hidden inside an image and shared without making the message visible to the naked eye.

Image Hiding: A small image can be embedded within a larger image.
